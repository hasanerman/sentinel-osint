# Global Sentinel

> **An advanced OSINT & Military Intelligence Radar Interface**

Global Sentinel is a high-performance, professional-grade web application built to identify, track, and map military installations and restricted areas globally. Utilizing Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, and the Overpass API, it provides intelligent spatial clustering and visualization of base perimeters, sub-units, and restricted zones.

## Features

* **Global Coverage:** Fetch and visualize military infrastructure data from around the world.
* **Intelligent Spatial Clustering:** Seamlessly merges nearby military structures and scattered data points into coherent base perimeters.
* **Interactive Radar UI:** A dark-themed, enterprise-grade radar interface for an immersive investigative experience.
* **Dynamic Search:** Navigate to any country or coordinate instantly using the built-in geolocation search functionality.
* **Detailed Asset Breakdown:** View categorized military points (bunkers, barracks, airfields, communication arrays) within identified bases.
* **Real-time Overpass Integration:** Pulls up-to-date node, way, and relation data from OpenStreetMap.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React, React-Leaflet, Web Animations API, Vite
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Axios (for Overpass API querying)
* **Mapping:** Leaflet, OpenStreetMap CartoDB Dark Matter tiles
